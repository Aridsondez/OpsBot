# OpsBot 


## Overview 
- OpsBot treats AI code changes as operations instead of just file diffs. When AI refactors your auth system or adds a feature, OpsBot records why it happened—not just what changed. This lets you revert, replay, or refine changes based on intent.
Think: git tracks file history. OpsBot tracks decision history.
